        <p class = "body-text text">6007 was started by two interested middle schoolers at the <a class = "links" href = "https://www.millikanmiddleschool.org/">Millikan Science Acadedmy<a/>. They knew practically nothing about vex, but with the help of some manuals and parents,
          the team enjoyed some moderate sucess in <a  href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ehrKSYfjkVex" class = "links"> Sack Attack<a/>. Enboldened, they added four additional team members
          the following year and made it to the MS World Championships, getting eliminated in the quarterfinals. The next year, the team split into three, due to some administrative issues.
          The number 6007 was taken by one of the initial two students, Aeden Gasser-Brennan. Aeden, along with Ben Adelstein, a beginner who was brought onto the team that year,
          made one of the better middle school <a class = "links" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ-5H3JVtPs">Skyrise<a/> robots. However, due to a freak accident at worlds,
          they went from first ranked to not making eliminations at worlds that year. During <a class = "links" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8daR6qBw3M">Nothing But Net<a/>, 6007's
          first High School year, Aeden went esentially solo, but was not able to do very well. Last year, in <a class = "links" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t2zstQ84Tw">Starstruck<a/>, Aeden and Ben reunited
          and were able to rank 5th in the world in High School. This year, 6007 (now officially 6007X) hopes to replicate this sucess with our new members, Ethan and John, and as a
